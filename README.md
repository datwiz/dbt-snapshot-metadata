# Adding Operational Metadata to dbt Snapshots

## Objectives
* use the out-of-the-box dbt snapshot logic and strategies for Change Data Capture (CDC)
* add operational metadata fields to snapshot tables with processing details for operational support and audit
* when new records are inserted, add operational processing metadata information to each record
* when an existing record is closed or end-dated, update operational metadata fields with operational processing metadata
